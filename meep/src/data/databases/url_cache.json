They mention that the content in the paste is encrypted with AES-256 using a key derived from \"heybinder.ex3\" with SHA-256 hash.\n\nFurther in the conversation, the user describes the process of decrypting the content where the initialization vector (IV) is the first 16 bytes of the encrypted data, followed by the cipher text. The decryption uses the Crypto library in Python.\n\nThe main points are:\n- A pastebin link is shared containing data.\n- The data is encrypted with AES-256.\n- The key is a SHA-256 hash of the string \"heybinder.ex3\".\n- The IV is the first 16 bytes of the encrypted data.\n- The rest is the actual encrypted message.\n- The decryption is done in Python with the Crypto library.\n\nThe conversation is about how to decrypt the content from that paste bin using the given key and IV extraction method.]",

The top row contains seven character cards, from left to right: Rocket Raccoon, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, Squirrel Girl, Star-Lord, Storm, and The Punisher. The bottom row contains six character cards, from left to right: The Thing, Thor, Ultron, Venom, Winter Soldier, and Wolverine. Each card shows a stylized portrait of the character with their name written at the bottom in uppercase white text. Some cards have small icons next to the names, possibly indicating character class or role. In the upper right corner of the image, there is a dropdown menu labeled \"TOUTES LES CLASSES,\" which is French for \"ALL CLASSES.\" The overall layout suggests a character selection or roster screen in a game interface.]",

Replies clarify that Discord shows game or app activity if the user has enabled the feature, but there is no way to see every app a user is running outside of what Discord displays. Users also mention privacy settings can limit this information and that bots or third-party tools cannot access more detailed running applications of users. The discussion revolves around the limits of Discord's presence/activity feature and privacy aspects.]",
